# Puppet language support in Pulsar

Add syntax highlighting and snippets to Puppet files in Pulsar.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate)
from the [Puppet TextMate bundle](https://github.com/cburyta/puppet-textmate.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
